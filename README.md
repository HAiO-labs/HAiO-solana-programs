# HAiO Solana Programs

## Overview

This repository contains Solana programs built with the Anchor framework for the HAiO project.  
All programs are open-source to ensure transparency and foster community collaboration.

## Programs

### 1. Early-Access Program

- Uses SHA-256 hashing of participant's public key for privacy protection
- Emits an event containing only the hashed wallet address and timestamp
- Requires only transaction signature verification
- No on-chain state storage (completely stateless design)

### 2. Daily Check-In Program

A Solana program allowing each user (wallet) to check in once per day (UTC-based).

- Uses a PDA (Program Derived Address) seeded by `["user-check-in", authority.pubkey]`.
- Emits an event on successful daily check-in.
- Fails if the user already checked in on the same day.

### 3. Create ATA Program

A Solana program that ensures a user has an Associated Token Account (ATA) for a specific service token, creating it if needed, and always emits a single on-chain event per call.

- Automatically creates the ATA for the user if it does not exist
- Skips ATA creation if it already exists
- Always emits a single event (`AtaCallEvent`) per call
- The event field `created_this_tx` is `true` if the ATA was created in this transaction, or `false` if it already existed

### 4. Withdraw Logger Program

A minimal Solana program for logging withdrawal requests.

- Emits single log line: WITHDRAW=<amount>
- No on-chain state storage (stateless design)
- Cheapest possible bookkeeping mechanism
- Requires only transaction signature verification

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) with `rustup`
- [Solana CLI Tools](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)
- [Anchor CLI](https://www.anchor-lang.com/)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HAiO-labs/solana-programs
cd solana-programs

# Install dependencies (using yarn, npm, or whichever package manager your project prefers)
yarn install

```

### Build and Test

```bash
# Build all programs
anchor build

# Run tests
anchor test

## Notes

- **Security.txt**: The references in `security_txt! { ... }` will appear on-chain if deployed without the `"no-entrypoint"` feature. This is optional but can help define security policies for your Solana program.
- **Program ID**: Ensure the `declare_id!()` matches the keypair used in `Anchor.toml` or your deployment process.
- **Testing**: The test code demonstrates using `EventParser` to ensure an event is actually emitted. If you prefer, you could also do manual base64 decoding.
